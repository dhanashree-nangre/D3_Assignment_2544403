# D3_Assignment_2544403
This repository contains a solution for the d3 assignment.
According to the assignment, we are supposed to show the town from this link: http://34.38.72.236/Circles/Towns/50 on maps.
In my solutions, I have added two types of maps: a regular one and a Google Maps overlay.
On regular maps that were created by paths using d3.js, there are multiple functions available on the Web page. such as
  1. Blue circles represent towns.
  2. Town names are visible beside them in white.
  3. The radius and opacity of the circle represent the population of the town. A larger radius means more population and less opacity means less population.
  4. There is a refresh button in the top right corner to reload the page.
  5. Using a slider, we can decide how many towns we want to see on the map.
  6. When we hover over a circle, we should also see a tooltip that contains information about the town name, longitude, latitude, and population.
  7. There is a button on the top left corner to open the page with a Google Maps view.
  8. Also there is a button to load a new set of town data.
  9. A transition happens as circles come into view gradually.

     
On the Google Maps page view, there are functionalities available.
  1. These maps show a more user-attractive view of Google Maps.
  2. The colour, opacity and radius of maps represent the population of the town.
  3. Town names are shown in black.
  4. There is a refresh button in the top right corner to reload the page.
  5. There is a button on the top left corner to open the page to another view of maps.
